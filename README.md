# NLP_Legal_case_classification_COLIEE2018

With the explosive growth of legal documents, automatic Legal Information Retrieval(LIR) is critical to help law professionals to conduct quality services. In this paper, we propose using association rules to retrieval relevant legal documents. Our method is tested on three COLIEE 2018 tasks, and achieve acceptable and stable performance on all the tasks.

Detail process and results are published as "Legal Information Retrieval by Association Rules".
